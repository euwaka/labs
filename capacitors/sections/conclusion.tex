\section{Conclusion}

To conclude, this experiment provided three major evidences for the theory of electromagnetism, including the linear relationship between the voltage of the capacitor and its charge, the fringing effect and the surface charge density, and the relation between the voltage of the capacitor and the separation of the capacitor. Despite big errors, the trends revealed themselves, and extrapolation of variables of interest can be improved by fully isolating the system. Even though the physics of electromagnetism is a model, it describes reality with large precision.
