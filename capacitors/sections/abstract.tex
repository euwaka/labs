Electromagnetism is an essential part of modern life, and accurate mathematical models are crucial for its effective use in applications ranging from biology to optical machinery. This lab report aims to provide evidence for the fundamental mathematical relationships in electromagnetism by calculating the capacitance and surface charge density of the capacitor as a function of spatial variables. The fringing effect is discussed and the causes of errors and corresponding improvements are mentioned.
