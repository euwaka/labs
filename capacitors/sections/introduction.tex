\section{Introduction}

The aim of this lab is to determine the capacitance of a parallel plate capacitor as a function of charge and separation of the capacitor plates; and to estimate the radial distribution of charge on the capacitor surface $\sigma(r) = \frac{\partial q}{\partial A}$. This lab report is divided into three parts and each part has its own \textit{Results}, \textit{Discussion}, and \textit{Data Appendix} sections. The setup and steps of execution of each part of the lab are described in Section \ref{sec:methods}. The results of the lab are used as experimental verification of the laws governing the parallel capacitors and general electromagnetism; and gaining insights into the way external objects interfere with the capacitor's electric properties.
